### Introduction

> The challenge: The year is 2050. Mars is teeming full of colonies – all working to survive and thrive in the harsh environment of space. Promethium, a valuable new mineral has been discovered by scientists that threatens the tenuous peace. To maintain order, the United Martian Colonies institutes a planet-wide mining system. Each colony is designated one mining bot to collect Promethium. You’ve been chosen to program a web application to monitor bots and nodes on behalf of the UMC. Think carefully about how you'll display rapidly changing information...

### Built With

I am choosing to work with simple html, css and javascript due to the time constraints and hopefully will have a fully implemented React view. This project is pulling information from a given api and I had trouble with getting information to render initially so I just did a simple api call with JS. If I had more time I would certainly attempt to use React more.

### Tradeoffs

In approaching the challenge it was extremely important to read over the task carefully in order to understand the challenge. The planning took longer than ideal and as a result the javascript and styling suffered a bit but I style tried to give styling a good design.

### UI Styling

Ultimately I really enjoying looking at something that is engaging, looks inviting and welcoming beyond just a simple grid. This is why I chose to make the end result look as visually appealing as possible given the time restraints. I stripped the grid completely and gave it warm purple and red tones to complement the image of a field at sunset to give it some nice warm vibes.

## Thank you!

I enjoyed working on this as it felt a good test of my skills while not being extremely overwhelming. I especially look forward to the feedback since it is given to every participant. Usually when doing code challenges or assignments it is very rare to receive constructive feedback, I appreciate being able to learn more and continue to improve my skills.
