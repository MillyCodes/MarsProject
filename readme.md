## Mars Discovery Project

#### Link to live demo, coming soon..

### Introduction

> The challenge: The year is 2050. Mars is teeming full of colonies – all working to survive and thrive in the harsh environment of space. Promethium, a valuable new mineral has been discovered by scientists that threatens the tenuous peace. To maintain order, the United Martian Colonies institutes a planet-wide mining system. Each colony is designated one mining bot to collect Promethium. You’ve been chosen to program a web application to monitor bots and nodes on behalf of the UMC. Think carefully about how you'll display rapidly changing information...

### Built With

I am choosing to work with simple html, css and javascript due to the time constraints and hopefully will have a fully implemented React view. This project is pulling information from a given api and I had trouble with it so I just did a simple api call.

### Tradeoffs

In approaching the challenge it was extremely important to read over the task carefully in order to understand the challenge. The planning took longer than ideal and as a result the javascript and styling suffered a bit but I style tried to give styling a good design.

## Thank you!
